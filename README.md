A collection of programs to crash computers.

Useful for testing recovery systems, autoscaling etc.

Also just hillarious =|-]


**_Please note all these programs are really bad for computers._**

**_Don't run them on anything important.  (Test or Crash-and-Burn machines only.)_**


_Also note: I've not put these together to harm anything, if you use them to break something you weren't allowed to then you need to get a life and deserve to be punished._

Having said that, the most fun you can have with these is on a spare bare metal box if you have one, then you don't risk overheating your primary workstation.  Otherwise a VM is cool, just make sure you're ready to kill it.
